## Overview

This project implements real-time object detection using the YOLO algorithm and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract. It provides a simple and efficient way to detect objects in images or video streams and extract text from them.

Key features include:

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv8n pre-trained model.
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract for text extraction.
- Support for live webcam feed for both object detection and OCR.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohan-Gautam/Object-Detection-and-OCR.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Object-Detection-and-OCR

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Use the provided scripts to utilize the functionalities:

   - To run object detection, execute:

     ```bash
     python object_detection.py
     ```

     This will activate your webcam and commence real-time object detection.

   - For Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on detected objects, run:

     ```bash
     python ocr.py
     ```

     This script will extract text from objects detected in the webcam feed.
